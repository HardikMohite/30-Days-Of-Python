📘 Day 05 – Python Loops

Today we learned loops in Python.
Loops help us repeat tasks without writing the code again and again.

Python provides two types of loops:

🔹 1. for Loop

Used when we know the number of repetitions.

Syntax:
for variable in range(start, stop, step):
    # code block

Meaning:

start → where loop begins

stop → runs until stop-1

step → how much value increases each time

🔹 2. while Loop

Used when we don’t know exact number of repetitions.
It runs as long as condition is true.

Syntax:
while condition:
    # code block

Meaning:

Loop continues until condition becomes False

🔹 Programs Covered Today
✔ Print 1 to 10
✔ Print even numbers
✔ Sum of first 10 numbers
✔ Multiplication table
✔ Nested loop 

These programs teach you how loops work in real tasks.
